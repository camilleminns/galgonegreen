<div id="about">
<h2>Hello,</h2>
<p>My name's Camille (she/her). I'm a climate justice advocate and intersectional environmentalist who loves engaging both myself and others in the work of sustainably. Climate justice is social justice, hands down, and I enjoy thinking about it, critically, especially as it relates to BIPOC and minority communities throughout the world.
<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Nassau, The Bahamas. Growing up on a small island - a land of sun, sand and sea - you can't help but feel a deep appreciation and connection to the Earth. I grew up in a country where I was never far away from the beach, where everyone knew a farmer or fisherman, and where fresh fruit was in abundance.
<br>
<br>
While living and growing up on a beautiful, Caribbean island has it's obvious and undeniable benefits, challenges still exist. As a archipelagic, coastal community, we are extremely vulnerable in the face of natural hazards, namely like hurricanes. The ironic part of it all is that, communities like mine make such miniscule contributions to global carbon emissions and many of the sustainability practices lauded as being innovated and eco-conscious in the West (e.g. line-drying clothes, reusing plastics, carpooling, gardening, etc.) are a part of our normal lifestyle. Yet, we still face a disproportionate threat to the effects of climate change.
<br>
<br>
This is why I engage in this work - because it's crucial to the survival of my country. I do not want to look down the line and have to tell anyone that my country is shrinking due to sea-level rise, or that my people are now climate refugees. The Unites States and larger countries like it, as well as corporations have a bigger role to play than any of us. Together, however, at all levels, we can and will make a difference.
